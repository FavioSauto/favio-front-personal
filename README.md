# To do

[x] Modularize and divide and conquer the code, there are many files with too much code
[x] Fetching events error fix
[] Fix the issue that re-fetches the states on every page change (start in dashboard everything loads, go to stats page, go back to dashboard it refetches info that it's already there)
[] Approval improvements
[] Form inputs onChange re renders everything and not only the input
